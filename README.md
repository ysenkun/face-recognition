## Environment setup
The Python environment is Python==3.7.0
```bash
$ conda create -n facenet python==3.7.0
$ conda activate facenet
```
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ysenkun/face_recognition.git
```
```bash
$ cd facenet_mask
```
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* NOTE: If you use any of the models, please do not forget to give proper credit to those providing the training dataset as well.
* Where to save the model:
```bash
$ cd facenet_mask
```
```bash
$ mkdir facenet_model
```

### Pre-trained models(For face detection)
[mask_detector.model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DdaF3eRnlbv2ssvsJhHqlGQTnlhqK2wi/view?usp=sharing)
After downloading the model, save it in the following directory
```bash
$ mv mask_detector.model facenet_mask/facenet/src/mask_detect
```

## Run

### Create DB(register)
To face recognition, register your face with the following command.When the following command is executed, the number of registered faces and their names will be entered and the image will be taken.
```bash
$ cd facenet_mask/facenet
```
â€»A on the keyboard to release the shutter (camera)
```bash
$ bash create.sh
```

### Face Recognition
It compares the face image with the one registered earlier and face recognition.
```bash
$ cd facenet_mask
```

```bash
$ bash camera.sh
```
